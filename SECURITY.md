## Reporting a Vulnerability

You should open an issue to the developer through the appropriate tab in GitHub and/or open a pull request with a fix you created and tested to work in your local environment.

Explain what the vulnerability is, how you fixed it, and what I should do to make sure it does not get reintroduced in a future build (if applicable).

Automated tools are also watching my own code and submissions made -- do not submit backdoors or viruses, they will be rejected and I will make a wall of shame if you do this.
